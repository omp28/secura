# Anonymous File Storage Web App

This web app allows users to securely store, manage, and share files using only a 12-digit string for login. No personal information is required, ensuring complete anonymity.

## Features

### 1. User Authentication (12-Digit String)

- Users log in with a unique 12-digit string.
- No email or personal information is collected.
- CAPTCHA and rate limiting prevent brute-force attacks.

### 2. Data Encryption and Compression

- All files are encrypted (AES-256) before storage.
- Files are compressed (ZIP/GZIP) to save space.
- Secure cloud storage for encrypted files.

### 3. Anonymous File Storage & Retrieval

- Files are mapped to the userâ€™s 12-digit string.
- After login, users can view a list of file titles.

### 4. File Preview and Download

### 6. Security Considerations

- Encryption keys derived from the 12-digit string (not stored).
- Rate limiting to protect against brute-force attacks.
- Users are responsible for their string (no recovery options).
